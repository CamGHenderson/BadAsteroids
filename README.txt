How To Play Bad Asteroids:

Starting:
- click on play button

Input:
- rotate with left/right or a/d keys
- add thrust in the direction the space ship is pointing with up or w keys
- shoot at asteroids with space bar

Goal:
- try to get high scores
- you get more points the more time you survive (1 point per second)
- you get ten points every time you shoot an asteroid
- if you get hit by an asteroid the game ends


Other Notes:
- I never actually added settings to the game, so if the window is too big for you monitor then make your window scaling smaller in settings.
- Also The linux one does not really work that well
- There is at least one bug where the game crashes but I have not been able to figure it out
